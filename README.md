#nocspinmodel

Use formal model in fitness operator of Generic Algorithm (GA) to generate population through mutation and crossover to identify optimal mapping solution in NoCs.

The results of formal mapping was publish in IEEE conference paper in 2014.

"Improving GA-based NoC mapping algorithms using a formal model", VA Palaniveloo, JA Ambrose, A Sowmya 2014 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI, 344-349

The formal model is compiled to C from SPIN Promela model and embedded into GA based mapping algorithm implemented in Python.
